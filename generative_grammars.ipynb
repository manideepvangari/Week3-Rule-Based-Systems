            " It was another ordinary morning in the university, where students shuffled into their classrooms, chatting about their assignments and upcoming exams.\n",
            " James sat in the lecture hall waiting for class to begin, his fingers tapping lightly on the desk as he stared out the window, lost in thought.\n",
            " Then, Sophia walked in, with her long black hair flowing like silk behind her, her presence effortlessly drawing his eyes towards her as she moved to her seat.\n",
            " James felt his heart stop as he struggled to look away, a warm rush spreading through his chest while his mind raced with thoughts of how he could speak to her. \n",
            " She was so freaking beautiful.\n",
            " For a brief moment, their eyes met, and she smiled before looking away. He noticed a soft smile at the corners of her lips, as if she too had felt a spark between them.\n",
            " Was it fate, or just a fleeting moment in time that would soon be forgotten? Only time would tell if this was the beginning of something real. \n",
            " Or was it just another passing day in the university?\n"
